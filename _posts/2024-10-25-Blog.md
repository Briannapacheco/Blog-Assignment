# White Sage
​Sage or scientifically known as salvia apiana is a tall stalky plant with pale leaves, known as a strong plant with an even stronger scent. The plant’s basal branches are filled with dense clusters of thickened, pale grey leaves that have a smooth and almost rubbery texture to them. Sage is known for being a spiritual and medicinal plant, specifically used in many indigenous ritual practices. Sage is traditionally recognized as the herb of immortality, domestic virtue, health, and wisdom. White sage is commonly known as the most used and seen as the most powerful of smudging material.Like the Romans, it is a ceremonial herb. White sage elicits smoke with a strong scent, which cleanses the participants by touching and/or inhaling it. There is an aesthetic experience elicited by white sage, it suggests the feeling of cleansing, blessing, and gracefully carries prayers.

# Smudging
The way that white sage is involved in ritualistic practices is being burnt for smudging. Smudging is the burning of herbs, not always sage, for the purpose of conducting a cleansing or healing ritual. When smudging with white sage it is important to have intention, without there is no purpose or meaning behind it. Smudging should also always be voluntary, this would also put ill intention into the ritual which could have negative or no effects. The first step is to cleanse a person, you may wash your hands with the smoke as you do under running water. There are smudge prayers that can be used during the ritual, although you may replace them with your own. The smudge prayers have a theme of speaking about the seeing good actions, hearing good sounds, think good thoughts and speaking good words, similar to the way you would speak manifestations into the universe. The sage is drawn over and around the head, eyes, ears, mouths, and bodies of those taking part. The process of smudging is as follows, gathering the plant, bundling it (as seen in the image), and drying the plant in preparation to be lit. After this, when it is time to preform the ritual there will be a dish with a pile of dried tobacco, which the sage bundle will be placed upon after the bottom is lit with a match. During this process sometimes eagle wings or feathers are used to manipulate the flowing of the smoke.
# Other 
Although there is no specific skills or attributes (including gender) needed to take part in smudging, it is especially important to recognize that is it a closed practice. This ritual is specific to Indigenous persons, however it has been further adopted into the religion of new world paganism, although this is highly controversial.
